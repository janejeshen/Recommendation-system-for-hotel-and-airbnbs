There are 2 beds in two rooms and 4 in one room. I do not have closet in this room but there are hangers and mini shelves. My travelers usually put their baggage on the floor. There is one full bathroom only for women in 2nd floor, which you will be sharing with other women guests. Right next that bathroom, there is unisex half bathroom. All bathrooms have hair dryers.

You can eat take-out food in the kitchen, but please wash dishes that you used and put trash in the</td>\n",

       "description             Hello, I've been running guest house for Koreans visiting U.S. for 3years, and recently decided to run this place for other travelers also. There are 10 room in the house. They are mostly dormitory rooms and couple of couple room and family room. This places are our women's dormitory in third floor. There are three rooms, but no doors. It is basically open space. There are 2 beds in two rooms and 4 in one room. I do not have closet in this room but there are hangers and mini shelves. My travelers usually put their baggage on the floor. There is one full bathroom only for women in 2nd floor, which you will be sharing with other women guests. Right next that bathroom, there is unisex half bathroom. All bathrooms have hair dryers. You cannot use kitchen, but you can use refrigerator.  I offer breakfast every morning from 7-10 am. Bread, cereal, fruits, coffee, milk and juice will be served. You can eat take-out food in the kitchen, but please wash dishes that you used and put trash in the   \n",

The building itself is charming, with 12 foot ceilings and hardwood floors. In the bedroom, I've installed a Murphy bed that folds up over a sofa.

       "41848  This is a throwback to pre WWII American development, back when you could have an apartment above a pub, next to a trolley stop, in a walkable, Mayberry type small town, yet just a few train stops away from Downtown Los Angeles and Old Pasadena. There are three excellent coffee shops within 100 yards of the building, an Irish Pub, a Spanish Tapas Restaurant, Indian Food, Sushi and a Thursday night farmer's market. The building itself is charming, with 12 foot ceilings and hardwood floors. In the bedroom, I've installed a Murphy bed that folds up over a sofa. The space is set up for comfortable living in the middle of an urban yet charming downtown neighborhood. The real charm is in the neighborhood and the proximity to the train. You can use the fridge, the stovetop, shower, both TV's and the front closet. Please contact me with any concerns via email. I want you to feel comfortable and enjoy your stay! This neighborhood is one of the best kept secrets in LA. In a city dominated by tra   \n",

       "98   Visiting the City? Come stay in my cozy apt in Manhattan!!! It's an amazing place to live right in Upper West Side. Quiet and with tons of sunlight. I love the neighborhood, so convenient, close to everything and charming: 1min walk to cool bars and restaurants, 3min to Columbia University, 1min to subway, 7min to Central Park and St.John the Divine Cathedral is right in my street. Also, you can take the subway and get to Times Sq in 15 min, Chelsea in 20, Soho in 30,  Green Point in 35... No matter how cold it's outside, the building remains always warm and cozy. Super quiet: my neighbors are the best. And sooo sunny the whole year. You'll love waking up here in a sunny morning. ONLY super super tidy and clean guests, professionals, responsible and able to give back the apartment exactly as I'll trust it to them: pristine :) I'll be out of town but you can contact me 24/7 if you need me.
